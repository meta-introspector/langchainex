#   Token Healing helps avoid token biases that occur during encoding of natural language.
#   For example in the prompt "https:<%= url %>" the encoding will turn the ':' into a token.
#   However the encoding may also have a token like '://' when it was trained.  So when it sees
#   the ':' token it doesn't sink in that this is part of an HTTP address.
#   Token Healing will try to replace ':' with '://'.
